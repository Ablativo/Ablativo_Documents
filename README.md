# Ablativo
Museums, the house of muses, some people love them, but for some, it is no more than a boring collection of lifeless things. 
However, here comes our application, Ablativo, intending to bring also those least interested people to the wonderful world of museums. 

## Idea

#### PROBLEM
For most people museums are boring, out-of-date, still too far from the contemporary idea of interactivity. 
Therefore, we want to renew this preconception, to bring closer also non-art lovers, providing them with a different way to learn new things.

#### SOLUTION
Make artwork come to life!
1. The user connects to the Ablativo mobile application;
2. When he/she approaches an artwork, it starts a new conversation with the user, via chat;
3. The user can now choose which question to ask the statue (for now precompiled ones);
4. The artwork, simulated by a bot, can answer questions or even make proposals to the user.

#### BENEFITS
- USERS: Interacting with the application, the users receive targeted information on the pieces of art they are interested in. 
	Therefore, they are not forced to read the entire description, but only ask for the things that interest them.


- MUSEUM: The application can collect information on the most frequently asked questions posed to statues, including which are most in-demand. 
	Then, these data could also help in advertising marketing strategies by analyzing visitors' interests more closely.

EXTRA: Once collected enough data, analyzing the interactions, the app could be extended to a real path inside the museum, guided by the statues. A real "treasure hunt" with the suggestions of the artworks.
