# Evaluation
This document aims to provide details on how to evaluate the product, first from a user experience point of view, and then from a technical point of view.

## User experience
To first evaluate the idea, we have used a survey, sharing it with our family, friends, and friends of friends. Indeed, by these feedbacks and suggestions, we (hopefully) understood where to make some changes, and especially if the final user would really like and possibly use the final service.

Here the anonymous results:
- [International](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IgMSvd-63VwI2cXw7SHC1U36O2IEgHQvG_yR56Y7Nk/edit#gid=675511585)
- [Italian](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfuZT_q8hNwSY7gu_bXCDNayzk7qYUeNwSBV3rvE9xY/edit#gid=510814664)

Here the most relevant graphs:

- [Italian](./pdf/graph_Italy.pdf)


We received more than 100 replies from Italian people, and more than 40 from people spread over 15 different countries. 
Over 90% of them believe this service would be useful to improve the learning of the fundamental characteristics of a work of art, help the museum to provide a better service, boost their curiosity, and would have fun trying the application.
The same percentage of people would go to the museum to try the novelty, however, in Italy, only around 50% if they have already been there, while in the other countries this percentage increases to ~65%.
Finally, over 80% of these people told us they are thinking to download for real our application on their smartphone.

Now, let's define the parameters we will use for the final evaluation:
- The museum visitor can easily sign-in/sign-up and choose his/her mentor;
- The museum visitor can easily interact with the mentor, which will have as natural as possible human-like behavior;
- The museum visitor will correctly receive messages from a work of art while standing close to it;
- The interaction between the mentor and the works of art will seem as natural as possible;
- The museum owner can easily understand the metrics collected by the service;
